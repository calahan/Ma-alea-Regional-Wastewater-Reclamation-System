The mean flow rate of sewage input to the system is `r FmtQuant(flow, 1)`, providing a convenient upper limit for the rate of R-1 water discharge into the Pond. Given that the floway is `r FmtQuant(fw_wid, 1)` wide, at a linear hydraulic loading rate (LHLR) of `r FmtQuant(lhlr, 1)`, the total hydraulic loading of the floway is `r FmtQuant(hlr, 1)`. Thus the mean daily turnover based on inflow is `r FmtQuant(flow_to, 1)`. The Pond volume is `r FmtQuant(s_vol, 1)`. Thus the mean daily turnover based on pond volume is `r FmtQuant(pond_to, 1)`. Given a mean algal productivity of `r FmtQuant(prod)` and weekly harvest, each harvest will have an ash free dry weight of `r FmtQuant()` and a biomass composition of , Each time a volume of water passes through the floway, a percentage of its nutrients are incorporated into algal biomass. so the entire volume needs to be run through the floway multiple times. For example, a `r FmtQuant(fw_wid[[1]], 1)` wide system pumping Pond water at a rate of `r FmtQuant(fw_lhlr[[1]] * fw_wid[[1]], 1)` will recirculate the total Pond volume in `r FmtQuant(ex_to, 2)` days. Runoff and infiltration from the local geography likely provides nutrient loading into the pond, explaining the ongoing need to take action against algal blooms. The current status of the Pond is probably the result of years of accumulation of excess nutrients. A floway of a size capable of removing one year's worth of nutrients per year would thus only stabilize it at current nutrient concentrations. Reducing these concentrations to a desired level requires a higher polishing capacity that would continue until the desired nutrient concentration is achieved, after which capacity would be reduced to the maintenance level.
