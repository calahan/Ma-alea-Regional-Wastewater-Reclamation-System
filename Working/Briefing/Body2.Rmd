Assume a mean daily flow rate of R-1 water into the Pond of `r FmtQuant(vol_inf, 1)`. Given a floway width of `r FmtQuant(fw_wid, 1)`, a linear hydraulic loading rate (LHLR) of `r FmtQuant(lhlr, 1)`, imposes a hydraulic loading rate (HLR) of `r FmtQuant(fwp$hlr, 1)`. Thus the mean daily turnover based on inflow is `r FmtQuant(fwp$inf_to, 1)`, or based on a Pond volume of `r FmtQuant(vol_res, 1)`, `r FmtQuant(fwp$res_to, 1)`. Given a mean algal productivity of `r FmtQuant(fw_prod, 1)` and weekly harvest, the mean harvest will have an ash free dry weight of `r FmtQuant(fwp$prod_w, 1)` and a biomass composition of `r FmtQuant(fwp$N_w, 1)` N and `r FmtQuant(fwp$P_w, 1)` P. At a solids content of `r FmtQuant(solids, 1)`
