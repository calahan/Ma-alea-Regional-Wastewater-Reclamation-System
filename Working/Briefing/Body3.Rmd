Each week, 
Each time a volume of water passes through the floway, a percentage of its nutrient content is removed by incorporation into algal biomass. so the entire volume needs to be run through the floway multiple times. For example, a `r #FmtQuant(fw_wid[[1]], 1)` wide system pumping Pond water at a rate of `r #FmtQuant(fw_lhlr[[1]] * fw_wid[[1]], 1)` will recirculate the total Pond volume in `r #FmtQuant(ex_to, 2)` days. Runoff and infiltration from the local geography likely provides nutrient loading into the pond, explaining the ongoing need to take action against algal blooms. The current status of the Pond is probably the result of years of accumulation of excess nutrients. A floway of a size capable of removing one year's worth of nutrients per year would thus only stabilize it at current nutrient concentrations. Reducing these concentrations to a desired level requires a higher polishing capacity that would continue until the desired nutrient concentration is achieved, after which capacity would be reduced to the maintenance level.
