\centerline{Abstract}
The final step in wastewater treatment at the Maui Regional Wastewater Reclamation System, currently under development, is algae-based water polishing. This process further reduces concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus after the membrane bioreactor sewage treatment system has dicharged R-1 water into the retention pond, using an algal cultivation practice known as algal turf scrubbing. Local algae are allowed to naturally attach to an artificial stream bed through which the decontaminated water flows, removing additional nutrients from the water as it proliferates. The polished water is used for irrigating a firebreak uphill of Maalea, while the biomass is split between use as a source of additional carbon for the solids pyrolysis function of the treatment plant, and as a soil amendment and slow-release biofertilizer for the firebreak.
