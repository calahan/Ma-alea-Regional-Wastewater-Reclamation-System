\centerline{Introduction}
The Maui Regional Wastewater Reclamation System (the System) comprises a standard modular sewage treatment component (the Plant), a retention pond (the Pond) and associated wetland (the Wetland), and as a final water polishing step, a filamentous algal cultivation channel known as an algal turf scrubber, or floway (the Floway). Treated water is used to irrigate an uphill fire resistant landcape (the Firebreak). The Floway is a wide, gently sloped artificial stream bed in which water from the Pond flows from the top of the bed (the Headworks) to the bottom (the Tailworks), at which point it is then used for irrigating the Fire Break or recirculates into the pond. Naturally present algae cells attach to the Floway and proliferate, rapidly uptaking nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and other nutrients from the Pond water. The algal biomass is harvested frequently to permanently remove nutrients from the System, and used as a soil amendment for the Firebreak.
