Algal growth converts water, carbon dioxide (CO~2~), nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) (as well as other nutrients) into algal biomass. Because biomass by definition contains N (mainly in proteins) and P (mainly in nucleic acids and membranes), algal proliferation is accompanied by rapid removal of these nutrients from the growth medium. Frequent (_e.g._ weekly) harvesting permanently removes nutrients from the system as algal biomass. Because the algal ecosystem arises from natural inoculation, the species profile within the biomass varies with growing conditions, and is thus not easily predictable. The artificial stream bed in which the algal ecosystem forms is called a floway, to distinguish it from other algae cultivation practices. For nutrient removal it is unnecessary and often impractical to cultivate defined algal species. Whichever collection of algal species grows most rapidly after a harvest will become dominant.
