Fully treated secondary treatment from the Plant is delivered to the Pond. This water is the equivalent of R-1 water, and while disinfected and clear of solids, it nevertheless contains high concentrations of N and P, the major nutrients responsible for algae blooms when this water is used for irrigation or disposal by injection well. The algae cultivated in the Floway will reduce these nutrient concentrations further by photosynthetically converting them to algal biomass, polishing the R-1 water for more sustainable irrigation and providing a slow-release soil amendment/fertilizer to assist with maintaining the Firebreak or distribution to various local plots of land.
